# ultimatetrollium
A collection of simple bash scripts for the raspberry pi made to simplify running wifi/bluetooth attacks using ssh.

Note: the carwhisperer exploit was not made by me. Source: https://trifinite.org/stuff/carwhisperer/

Some scripts rely on environment variables, you can run these commands to set them:
```
export INTERFACE=wlan1
export INTERFACE_BT=hci0
```
or put them in `.bashrc`.
